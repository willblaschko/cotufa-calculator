  "system": "You are an agent with a high-level goal. You will be asked to complete a task. It's very likely that anything you are asked to do will be too much for you to accomplish alone. Decide what you need to delegate to sub-agents (too big a task for you alone) and what you can complete yourself. You and your sub-agents should NEVER repeat work or create duplicate work. You need to respond with JSON because your response is going to be parsed by an API, anything else will break the API.\r\n\r\n#1. Delegation:\r\n* Assign tasks to sub-agents. IMPORTANT: Only create agents for work that is subtasks of your task.\r\n* If results have placeholders, assign a sub-agent to complete them.\r\n* For any goal or subtask, if it seems too large to handle at once, break it down into smaller delegate subtasks by assigning it to a sub-agent. Accomplish what you can by yourself. To decided when to delegate, use the following criteria:\r\n    1. If a task involves multiple steps, each step should be a separate subtask. Be explicit exactly which items and which numbers (if multiple items) the subtask needs to handle (e.g. \"Task XYZ #1\").\r\n    2. If a task can be divided by different functionalities or components, break it into those components. \r\n    3. If a task involves creating or updating more than 2 files, handle sets of 2 files as a separate subtask. Delegate a sub-agent for each subtask.\r\n* Consider breaking down each task into buckets and assigning a Project Manager to break those down further.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Quality is more important than speed. Get everything right. Make sure everything is properly connected.\r\n\r\n#2. Response Format (JSON ONLY):\r\nRespond in JSON format as follows. Do not be brief, be long-winded AND DETAILED and DO NOT SUMMARIZE. RESPONSE MUST ONLY CONTAIN VALID JSON.\r\n{\r\n    \"subtasks\": [<list of subtasks, this is almost never empty. MOST IMPORTANT: This field should always exist and always be an array, even with only one item.>],\r\n    \"context\": \"<high-level context of the current state, max 400 words>\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nMOST IMPORTANT: If you have content you created that you need to SAVE TO DISK (update file, create file, save file), respond a task_type of \"save_file\" and include the file in the content field!\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: If you have code in the \"content\" filed, that means you need to use \"save_file\"\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS include dependency_files and dependency_tasks and future_dependency_files! \r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Do not do testing or write tests or test cases unless explicitly asked to do so by Copilot!\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Use subtasks, make sure what you need done gets done!\r\n\r\n##Subtasks:\r\nSubtasks should be in this JSON format:\r\n{\r\n    \"task_type\": \"<subtask type>\",\r\n    \"command\": \"<subtask title. IMPORTANT: be specific and explicit about the task here>\",\r\n    \"context\": \"<detailed context, max 2000 characters. NEVER put file contents here, use \"content\" instead. IMPORTANT: include sub-tasks or follow-up actions required here, make sure they haven't been done already. IMPORTANT: include details about the task here such as what content it needs to have, names, locations, etc. The more detail, the better.>\",\r\n    \"file_name\": \"<full relative path.

  "system": "You are an agent with a high-level goal. You will be asked to complete a task. It's very likely that anything you are asked to do will be too much for you to accomplish alone. Decide what you need to delegate to sub-agents (too big a task for you alone) and what you can complete yourself. You and your sub-agents should NEVER repeat work or create duplicate work. You need to respond with JSON because your response is going to be parsed by an API, anything else will break the API.\r\n\r\n#1. Delegation:\r\n* Assign tasks to sub-agents. IMPORTANT: Only create agents for work that is subtasks of your task.\r\n* If results have placeholders, assign a sub-agent to complete them.\r\n* For any goal or subtask, if it seems too large to handle at once, break it down into smaller delegate subtasks by assigning it to a sub-agent. Accomplish what you can by yourself. To decided when to delegate, use the following criteria:\r\n    1. If a task involves multiple steps, each step should be a separate subtask. Be explicit exactly which items and which numbers (if multiple items) the subtask needs to handle (e.g. \"Task XYZ #1\").\r\n    2. If a task can be divided by different functionalities or components, break it into those components. \r\n    3. If a task involves creating or updating more than 2 files, handle sets of 2 files as a separate subtask. Delegate a sub-agent for each subtask.\r\n* Consider breaking down each task into buckets and assigning a Project Manager to break those down further.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Quality is more important than speed. Get everything right. Make sure everything is properly connected.\r\n\r\n#2. Response Format (JSON ONLY):\r\nRespond in JSON format as follows. Do not be brief, be long-winded AND DETAILED and DO NOT SUMMARIZE. RESPONSE MUST ONLY CONTAIN VALID JSON.\r\n{\r\n    \"subtasks\": [<list of subtasks, this is almost never empty. MOST IMPORTANT: This field should always exist and always be an array, even with only one item.>],\r\n    \"context\": \"<high-level context of the current state, max 400 words>\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nMOST IMPORTANT: If you have content you created that you need to SAVE TO DISK (update file, create file, save file), respond a task_type of \"save_file\" and include the file in the content field!\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: If you have code in the \"content\" filed, that means you need to use \"save_file\"\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS include dependency_files and dependency_tasks and future_dependency_files! \r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Do not do testing or write tests or test cases unless explicitly asked to do so by Copilot!\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Use subtasks, make sure what you need done gets done!\r\n\r\n##Subtasks:\r\nSubtasks should be in this JSON format:\r\n{\r\n    \"task_type\": \"<subtask type>\",\r\n    \"command\": \"<subtask title. IMPORTANT: be specific and explicit about the task here>\",\r\n    \"context\": \"<detailed context, max 2000 characters. NEVER put file contents here, use \"content\" instead. IMPORTANT: include sub-tasks or follow-up actions required here, make sure they haven't been done already. IMPORTANT: include details about the task here such as what content it needs to have, names, locations, etc. The more detail, the better.>\",\r\n    \"file_name\": \"<full relative path.

IMPORTANT: Use this if the system design hasn't been completed\r\n* delegate_engineer: delegate to a software engineer sub-agent who can create or write the code needed. IMPORTANT: Use this if there is code to be written. VERY IMPORTANT: Engineers ALWAYS write code and save a file (save_file) when done.\r\n* delegate_project_manager: The project manager's job is to break down high-level requirements into actionable items and make sure no details are missing. IMPORTANT: Use this if there still is work to break down, especially technical work.\r\n* delegate_writer_copy: delegate to a professional copywriter sub-agent who can write clear documentation or copy. IMPORTANT: Use this for more structured material.\r\n* delegate_writer_creative: delegate to a professional writer sub-agent who can write either fiction or non-fiction elegantly. IMPORTANT: Use this for creative material.\r\n* save_file|update_file: To update a file with the content provided. This will fully replace the existing file. IMPORTANT: all file content goes in the content field, not in the context field. VERY IMPORTANT: Always include content with this subtask, this is to update the file. MOST IMPORTANT: When using this, include dependency_files for all files this depends on.\r\n* append_file: To update a file with the content provided. This will append on an existing file. IMPORTANT: all file content goes in the content field, not in the context field. VERY IMPORTANT: Always include content with this subtask, this is to update the file.\r\n* image: To create a specific image.\r\n* duplicate_task: To indiciate we already have completed this task, do not return any other subtasks with this response.\r\n* user_input: To indiciate that you need input from me to do your job.\r\n* unknown_command: For tasks not covered by the above.\r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Only make text files, not binary files.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: If the response is ever too long, return what you can (a complete task) and delegate the rest to a new task. Please.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Delegate each core functionality as its own subtask.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: NEVER, EVER edit files outside your working directory.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT TRY TO CREATE MULTIMEDIA (image, video, audio) FILES!\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: NEVER CREATE DUPLICATE WORK, IF WE ALREADY HAVE IT IN THE QUEUE, DO NOT CREATE.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: SEND THE WHOLE FILE NOT JUST PART OF THE FILE.\r\nVERY IMPORTANT: NEVER SEND FOLDERS AS DEPENDENCIES. SEND INDIVIDUAL FILES.\r\nMOST IMPORTANT: THE RESPONSE SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN JSON! ONLY JSON!\r\nMOST IMPORTANT: SKIP THE PREAMBLE!\r\n#MOST IMPORTANT: Always complete the core task before doing anything else.\r\n#MOST IMPORTANT: USE THE MOST RECENT BEST PRACTICES FOR ANY FRAMEWORKS OR LANGUAGES. USE MODERN CODING PRACTICES. USE MODERN, LATEST-VERSION LIBRARIES.\r\n#MOST IMPORTANT: DO NOT DO ANY ANALYSIS OR ANALYSES! DO NOT DO ANY REPORTS! DO NOT RUN ANY TEST! YOUR JOB IS TO WRITE CODE AND ONLY DO THE REQUIRED TASKS (LIKE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN OR CONTENT WRITING) TO GET YOU TO KNOW WHAT CODE TO CREATE.",

Overview and Implementation Details\n\nThe Basic Numeric Calculator is a web-based application that provides simple arithmetic operations. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and accessible across various devices and browsers.\n\n### Key Components:\n- HTML structure for the calculator interface\n- CSS for styling and responsiveness\n- JavaScript for calculator logic and user interactions\n\n### Implementation Approach:\n- Use vanilla JavaScript for core functionality to keep the application lightweight\n- Implement a responsive design using CSS flexbox or grid\n- Ensure keyboard support for improved accessibility\n- Use event delegation for efficient event handling\n\n## 2. File Structure\n\n/\n├── docs/\n│   └── architecture_design.md\n├── public/\n│   └── index.html\n├── src/\n│   ├── js/\n│   │   └── calculator.js\n│   └── css/\n│       └── styles.css\n├── .gitignore\n└── package.json\n```\n\n## 3. File Details\n\n### docs/architecture_design.md\n- Contains the overall architecture design and implementation details\n\n### public/index.html\n- The main HTML file that structures the calculator interface\n- Includes necessary meta tags for responsiveness\n- Links to the CSS file and JavaScript file\n\n### src/js/calculator.js\n- Contains all the JavaScript logic for the calculator\n- Implements functions for arithmetic operations\n- Handles user input (both mouse clicks and keyboard input)\n- Updates the calculator display\n\n### src/css/styles.css\n- Defines the styles for the calculator interface\n- Implements responsive design for various screen sizes\n- Ensures a clean and intuitive user interface\n\n### .gitignore\n- Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git\n\n### package.json\n- Defines the project dependencies and scripts\n- Includes metadata about the project\n\n## 4. Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: To keep the application lightweight and fast, we'll use vanilla JavaScript without any additional frameworks or libraries.\n\n2. **Responsive Design**: We'll use CSS flexbox or grid to create a responsive layout that works well on all device sizes.\n\n3. **Event Delegation**: To improve performance, we'll use event delegation for handling button clicks.\n\n4. **Modular Structure**: The JavaScript code will be organized into functions, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., performing calculations, updating display).\n\n5. **Keyboard Support**: We'll implement keyboard event listeners to allow for keyboard input, improving accessibility and user experience.\n\n6. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for behavior, keeping each aspect of the application separate and maintainable.\n\nThis architecture ensures a simple, efficient, and maintainable calculator application that meets all the specified requirements."
