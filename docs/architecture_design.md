# Architecture Design: Basic Numeric Calculator

## 1. Overview and Implementation Details

The Basic Numeric Calculator is a web-based application that provides simple arithmetic operations. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and accessible across various devices and browsers.

### Key Components:
- HTML structure for the calculator interface
- CSS for styling and responsiveness
- JavaScript for calculator logic and user interactions

### Implementation Approach:
- Use vanilla JavaScript for core functionality to keep the application lightweight
- Implement a responsive design using CSS flexbox or grid
- Ensure keyboard support for improved accessibility
- Use event delegation for efficient event handling

## 4. Key Design Decisions

1. **Vanilla JavaScript**: To keep the application lightweight and fast, we'll use vanilla JavaScript without any additional frameworks or libraries.

2. **Responsive Design**: We'll use CSS flexbox or grid to create a responsive layout that works well on all device sizes.

3. **Event Delegation**: To improve performance, we'll use event delegation for handling button clicks.

4. **Modular Structure**: The JavaScript code will be organized into functions, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., performing calculations, updating display).

5. **Keyboard Support**: We'll implement keyboard event listeners to allow for keyboard input, improving accessibility and user experience.

6. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for behavior, keeping each aspect of the application separate and maintainable.

This architecture ensures a simple, efficient, and maintainable calculator application that meets all the specified requirements.
