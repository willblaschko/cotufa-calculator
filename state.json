  "taskPrompt": "# Project Summary: Basic Numeric Calculator Web Application\n\n## Overview\nThe Basic Numeric Calculator is a web-based application designed to offer users a straightforward and efficient tool for performing arithmetic calculations. This project integrates a user-friendly front-end interface with robust back-end logic and a comprehensive suite of testing frameworks to ensure functionality, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility. Built using semantic HTML, CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for functionality, the application adheres to best practices in modern web development.\n\n## Desired Customer Experience\nThe application aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. Users should be able to perform calculations effortlessly, with a clear display area for results and responsive buttons for input. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing interaction through both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, thus ensuring accessibility for all users. The application is also equipped to handle edge cases gracefully, providing informative error messages when necessary.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. User Interface (UI)\n- **index.html**: Structures the calculator interface, featuring a display area and buttons for digits and operations.\n- **CSS Files**: \n  - `src/css/styles.css` and `src/index.css` ensure a visually appealing and responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.\n\n### 2. Core Functionality\n- **JavaScript Logic**: \n  - `src/js/calculator.js`: Contains the core logic for arithmetic operations, managing the calculator's state, and updating the display.\n  - `src/index.js`: Serves as the entry point, initializing the calculator once the DOM is fully loaded.\n\n### 3. Testing Frameworks\n- **Unit Testing**: \n  - `src/js/calculator.test.js`: Uses Jest to verify the functionality of arithmetic operations and input handling.\n- **End-to-End Testing**: \n  - `tests/e2e/calculator.spec.js`: Utilizes Cypress for comprehensive tests on the calculator's functionalities, including responsiveness and edge cases.\n- **Cross-Browser Testing**: \n  - `tests/cross-browser-config.js` and `tests/cross-browser-runner.js`: Set up and execute tests across multiple browsers using BrowserStack and Selenium WebDriver to ensure consistent behavior.\n- **Accessibility Testing**: \n  - `tests/accessibility/a11y.test.js`: Implements Puppeteer and Axe-core to check for compliance with accessibility standards, ensuring usability for all users.\n\n### 4. Test Data Generation\n- **test-data-generator.js**: Generates various test cases covering basic arithmetic operations, edge cases, and error conditions to ensure comprehensive test coverage.\n\n### 5. Configuration Management\n- **test-config.js**: Centralizes configuration settings for the testing environment, including base URLs, browser configurations, and accessibility testing parameters.\n\n### 6. Documentation\n- **docs/architecture_design.md**: Provides an overview of architectural decisions, file structure, and implementation approach, ensuring clarity for future development and maintenance.\n\n### 7. Test Results Management\n- **test_results_summary.json**: Summarizes the outcomes of various tests, including total tests conducted, passed, and failed, with detailed results categorized by test type.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe project relies on several key dependencies for testing and functionality, including:\n- **Testing Libraries**: Jest, Cypress, Puppeteer, Axe-core, Selenium WebDriver, and BrowserStack.\n- **CSS Frameworks**: Custom styles defined in CSS files to ensure responsive design and accessibility.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Basic Numeric Calculator project is a comprehensive web application that integrates a user-friendly interface with robust functionality and extensive testing. By focusing on modular design, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility, the project aims to deliver a reliable and enjoyable user experience. The outlined components and structure provide a clear roadmap for the technical team to build upon, ensuring all aspects of the application are covered and aligned with the desired customer experience.",
